# 🛡️ DEFENX – AI-Based Anomaly Detection System for Personal Device Security

**Built by: Joyal, Akhilesh, and Jikku**  
DEFENX isn’t just a mini project — it’s your silent digital guardian.  
Crafted in Python, DEFENX watches over your system 24/7, detecting suspicious behaviors in real time and reacting — **before you even blink**.

It doesn’t wait for instructions.  
It hunts anomalies.

---

## ⚔️ Why DEFENX?

Every click, scroll, and tap leaves digital footprints.  
But what if something goes off track — without you even noticing?

**DEFENX senses the invisible, flags the unspoken:**

- 🔁 Sudden network changes  
- 🔐 Multiple login or password spray attempts  
- 🖱️ Rapid mouse/touch activity  
- 📈 Unexpected CPU or RAM spikes  

Instead of asking “What’s wrong?” — **DEFENX has already taken action**.

---

## 🔍 What Makes It Special?

- 🧠 **Python-powered AI** (Isolation Forest)
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Real-time behavior tracking**
- ⚙️ **Auto-triggered responses** — no clicks required
- 🔊 **Voice alerts** — when silence isn’t enough
- 💻 **Lightweight GUI** with Tkinter
- 🧪 **No copied brains** — custom-built logic from scratch
